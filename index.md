I am a doctoral student in the [Sociology Department](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/sociology/gradstudents/fh5495) at the University of Texas at Austin. I am affiliated with the [Population Research Center](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/prc/gradstudents/fh5495), [Center for Aging and Population Sciences](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/caps/people/), and the [Urban Ethnography Lab](https://sites.utexas.edu/ethnolab/people/fellows/) at UT Austin. 

My research centers on how gender and family processes shape economic and health inequalities across the life course, with a focus on gender and sexual minority (LGBTQI+) populations. My dissertation project, tentatively titled "Queer Money Talks," examines how queer social relationships such as close friendships, parent-child relationships, and romantic partnerships shape their economic actions, financial decisions, and, eventually, the economic and health consequences. In my other project, I worked on the embodied costs of gender nonconformity in the labor market. I use survey data to examine how gender nonconformity shapes individuals' labor market outcomes across their gender and sexual identities, specifically focusing on wage penalty and occupational characteristics. 

I have the opportunity to work with many talented collaborators. In one larger project, my collaborators and I examine [the timing to dating relationships](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/02654075231185763) (with Sara Mernitz and Meg Bishop) and [union formations](https://doi.org/10.1215/00703370-11380562) (with Sara Mernitz and Amanda Pollitt) among sexual minority youth, and the mental health consequences of intimate relationships for sexual minority youth (with Sara Mernitz). In another project, Faith Deckard, Shannon Malone Gonzalez, and I examine how different types of police contact shape Black women's mental health using a novel dataset made possible by Shannon Malone Gonzalez.

My works have been published in [*Demography*](https://doi.org/10.1215/00703370-11380562) the [*Journal of Personal and Social Relationships*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/02654075231185763), [*Information, Communication & Society*](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1369118X.2019.1657161?journalCode=rics20), and [*Continuum*](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10304312.2017.1409341?journalCode=ccon20).

I am currently a research assistant in the [Health and Relationship Project](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/health-relationships-lab/) under the supervision of Dr. Deb Umberson. 

Outside academia, I am a home cook and a proud kitty foster parent.
