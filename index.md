I am a doctoral student in the [Sociology Department](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/sociology/gradstudents/fh5495) at the University of Texas at Austin. I am affiliated with the [Population Research Center](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/prc/gradstudents/fh5495), [Center for Aging and Population Sciences](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/caps/people/), and the [Urban Ethnography Lab](https://sites.utexas.edu/ethnolab/people/fellows/) at UT Austin. 

My research centers on economic and health inequalities at the intersection of gender, sexuality, and family across the life course. My dissertation project, tentatively titled "Towards Relational Sociology of Wealth," examines familial wealth as relational processes that are embedded within familial relationships and negotiated vis-Ã -vis family members' social and familial positions. In my other project, I work on the embodied costs of gender nonconformity in the labor market. Using survey data, I examine how gender nonconformity shapes individuals' labor market outcomes, with a specific focus on wage penalty, and how it varies across gender and sexual identity. 

I have the opportunity to work with many talented collaborators. In one larger project, my collaborators and I examine [the timing to dating relationships](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/02654075231185763) (with Sara Mernitz and Meg Bishop) and union formations (with Sara Mernitz and Amanda Pollitt) among sexual minority youth, and the mental health consequences of intimate relationships for sexual minority youth (with Sara Mernitz). In another project, Faith Deckard, Shannon Malone Gonzalez, and I examine how different types of police contact shape Black women's mental health, using a novel dataset made possible by Shannon Malone Gonzalez.

My works appeared in the [*Journal of Personal and Social Relationships*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/02654075231185763), [*Information, Communication & Society*](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1369118X.2019.1657161?journalCode=rics20), and [*Continuum*](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10304312.2017.1409341?journalCode=ccon20).

I am currently a research assistant in the [Health and Relationship Project](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/health-relationships-lab/) under the supervision of Dr. Deb Umberson. 

Outside of academia, I am a home cook and a proud kitty foster parent.
