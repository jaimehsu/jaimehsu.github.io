I am a doctoral student in the [Sociology Department](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/sociology/gradstudents/fh5495) at the University of Texas at Austin. I am affiliated with the [Population Research Center](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/prc/gradstudents/fh5495), [Center for Aging and Population Sciences](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/caps/people/), and the [Urban Ethnography Lab](https://sites.utexas.edu/ethnolab/people/fellows/) at UT Austin. 

My research centers on how gender and family processes shape economic and health inequalities across the life course, with a focus on gender and sexual minority (LGBTQI+) populations. My dissertation project examines their experiences at the intersection of work, family, and well-being. 

In my other project, I worked on the embodied costs of gender nonconformity in the labor market. I use survey data to examine how gender nonconformity shapes individuals' labor market outcomes across their gender and sexual identities, specifically focusing on wage penalty. I also have the opportunity to work with many talented collaborators. In one larger project, my collaborators and I examine the timing to dating relationships [*(Mernitz, Hsu and Bishop 2023)*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/02654075231185763) and union formations [*(Mernitz, Hsu and Pollitt 2024)*](https://doi.org/10.1215/00703370-11380562) among sexual minority youth, and the mental health consequences of intimate relationships for sexual minority youth (*Hsu and Mernitz Forthcoming*). In another project, Faith Deckard, Shannon Malone Gonzalez, and I examine how different types of police contact shape Black women's mental health using a novel dataset made possible by Shannon Malone Gonzalez. 

Despite my quantitative research, I began my research experience as a qualitative researcher in the field of transnational family and information technologies ([*Hsu 2021*](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1369118X.2019.1657161?journalCode=rics20)). I am currently part of a collaborative qualitative research on bi+ people and their marital relationships with a wonderful research team from UT-Austin, Ohio State University, and University of Alabama at Birmingham.

My works have been published in [*Demography*](https://doi.org/10.1215/00703370-11380562), *Social Science Research*, [*Information, Communication & Society*](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1369118X.2019.1657161?journalCode=rics20), and others.

I am currently a research assistant in the [Health and Relationship Project](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/health-relationships-lab/) under the supervision of Dr. Deb Umberson. 

Outside academia, I am a home cook and a proud kitty foster parent.
