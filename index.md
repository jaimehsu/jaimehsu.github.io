I am on the 2025-2026 academic job market and would be happy to meet at ASA or virtually. See my [CV](https://jaimehsu.github.io/CV_Jaime.pdf)

Hi, I'm Jaime Hsu. I'm a doctoral candidate in Sociology with a specialization in Demography at the University of Texas at Austin. My research focuses on gender and family processes that shape economic and health inequalities across the life course, with a focus on gender and sexual minority (LGBTQI+) populations. My works are published or forthcoming in [*Social Problems*](https://doi.org/10.1093/socpro/spae050), [*Demography*](https://doi.org/10.1215/00703370-11380562), *Social Forces*, [*Social Science Research*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2024.103049), and others. I am affiliated with the [Population Research Center](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/prc/gradstudents/fh5495), [Center for Aging and Population Sciences](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/caps/people/), and the [Urban Ethnography Lab](https://sites.utexas.edu/ethnolab/people/fellows/) at the University of Texas at Austin. 

My dissertation project examines the intersection of work, family, and health across different-sex and same-sex families using national US  and dyadic data. In addition to my dissertation, I worked on the embodied costs of gender nonconformity in the labor market. I use survey data to examine how gender nonconformity shapes individuals' labor market outcomes across their gender and sexual identities [*(Hsu 2024)*](https://doi.org/10.1093/socpro/spae050). Other collaborative projects include the timing to dating relationships [*(Mernitz, Hsu and Bishop 2023)*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/02654075231185763) and to union formations [*(Mernitz, Hsu and Pollitt 2024)*](https://doi.org/10.1215/00703370-11380562) among sexual minority youth, and the mental health consequences of intimate relationships for sexual minority youth [(*Hsu and Mernitz 2024*)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2024.103049). 

With Drs. Faith Deckard (UCLA), Shannon Malone Gonzalez (UNC-Chapel Hill), and Yasmiyn Irizarry (UT Austin), our projects examine how different types of police contact contributes to Black women's mental health using a novel dataset, one of which has been accepted at *Social Forces*. (**In Her Place**, data effort by Drs. Shannon Malone Gonzalez & Yasmiyn Irizarry).

I am  a graduate researcher in the [Health and Relationship Project](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/health-relationships-lab/) under the supervision of Dr. Deb Umberson, and part of a collaborative qualitative research on bi+ people and their marital dynamics with researchers from UT Austin, Ohio State University (Dr. Rin Reczek), and University of Alabama at Birmingham (Dr. Mieke Thomeer). Originally, I started as a qualitative researcher in the field of transnational family and information technologies ([*Hsu 2021*](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1369118X.2019.1657161?journalCode=rics20)). 

Outside academia, I am a home cook and a proud kitty foster parent.
